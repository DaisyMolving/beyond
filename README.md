# Beyond

Beyond is a tool to book flights, accommodation and car rental all in one place. 

Collaborate with others to build the perfect getaway experience.

Discover unique travel experiences, that are tried and trusted by other travellers.

Take the tedium out of travel booking by prefilling preferences and creating trip profiles.


## To run:

From your terminal, navigate to `beyond` and run:

`open beyond/app/html/index/html`

or open on a browser with your operating system's file navigation system.

## To develop:

You will need to run Sass with the watch flag, with the command:

`sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets`


## Future development plans:

This app is still in development. As well as iteration on the current prototype, future features to be added are:

- Exploration map for the adventurous traveller
- Development of trip profiles for each traveller's common preferences, for work or pleasure
- "Freaky flyers club", features to help ease the anxiety of flying
- A collaborative pinboard map and wishlist feature

All feedback is welcome!
