# Beyond

Beyond is a tool to book flights, accommodation and car rental all in one place. 

Collaborate with others to build the perfect getaway experience.

Discover unique travel experiences, that are tried and trusted by other travellers.

Take the tedium out of travel booking by prefilling preferences and creating trip profiles.


## To run:

Download or `git clone` this project.

Either navigate to the file `index.html` within `app/html` and right click to open with your favourite browser, or

From your terminal, navigate to `beyond` and run:

`open beyond/app/html/index/html`

## To develop:

You will need to run Sass, which requires Ruby.

If you have a macOS system, install homebrew (package manager) with: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

then run `brew install ruby`

and `brew install sass/sass/sass`.

Once Sass is installed, navigate to the `beyond` and run Sass with the watch flag:

`sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets`


## Future development plans:

This app is still in development. As well as iteration on the current prototype, future features to be added are:

- Exploration map for the adventurous traveller
- Development of trip profiles for each traveller's common preferences, for work or pleasure
- "Freaky flyers club", features to help ease the anxiety of flying
- A collaborative pinboard map and wishlist feature

All feedback is welcome!
